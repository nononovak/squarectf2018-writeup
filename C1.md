# C1: dot-and-dash

This challenge provided [an HTML file](./files/dot-n-dash/dot-n-dash.html) and an [instructions file](./files/dot-n-dash/instructions.txt).

## Solution

Looking at the javascript code in the HTML file, there is an `_encode()` function which performs the entire encoding procedure. This function roughly does the following:

* create an array `a` which contains integers for each bit index in the encoded string
* shuffle the array `a`
* output the integers in the array as lengths of `-` characters separated by `.`

So in order to decode the provided `.-`'s in th instructions file, all that needs to be done is to reconstruct the `a` array, sort it, and convert each bit value back to a character. This was done with some simple python code below.

```python
data = open('dot-n-dash/instructions.txt').read()

lens = [len(x) for x in data.strip().split('.')]
lens.sort()

st = []
for i in range(0,max(lens),8):
	ch = 0
	for j in range(8):
		if i+j+1 in lens:
			ch = ch | (1<<j)
	st.append(chr(ch))

st.reverse()
print(''.join(st))
```

Running it gives the flag:

```
$ ./dot-n-dash-solve.py 
Instructions to disable C1:
1. Open the control panel in building INM035.
2. Hit the off switch.

Congrats, you solved C1! The flag is flag-bd38908e375c643d03c6.
